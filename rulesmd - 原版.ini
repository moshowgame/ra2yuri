; ******* IQ setting for computer activity *******
; Each player (computer controlled or otherwise) is given an IQ rating that is used
; to control what the computer is allowed to automatically control. This is
; distinct from the difficulty setting. The higher the IQ setting, the more autonomous
; and intelligent the side will behave. Each ability is given a rating that
; indicates the IQ level (or above) that the ability will be granted. Because such
; abilities are automatically performed by the computer, giving a human controlled
; country a high IQ is not recommended. Otherwise the player's units will start to
; automatically "do their own thing"! A human controlled country is presumed to have
; an IQ rating of zero. A computer controlled country has an IQ of 1 or higher.
; When in skirmish mode or when multiplayer AIs are active, the computer IQ is set to
; the maximum.

;Enough of theirs.  Here's the real stuff.  VeteranXXX can be used to make all units
;of that type start as veterans.  Please stay clear on the meaning of Infantry, Unit, and Aircraft.
;For % bonuses, the unit ones are made up up two words: the category and the type it applies to.
;Column A: Armor, Cost, Speed(units), BuildTime
;Column B: Aircraft, Units, Infantry, Buildings, Defenses
;Column C: Mult (to remind you that this is a straight multiplier instead of the formulas they used.)
;Exception is IncomeMult, which is applied when gaining money from refining ore only, but, well, it doesn't actually work.  Umm...sorry.  3/22 Maybe it does now...lemme check...yeah!  it works now!

;For armor, think of max strength being multiplied by the number (in reality, damage is divided by this since you can't change the max in Type)

;This is the ColorAdd section
;These are the colors used to tint buildings, such as when they are designated for an Airstrike
;In order to prevent slowdown in the low level blitting routines, this functionality was implemented
;by doing a composite bitwise or. This means that the color value is not being shifted, instead the
;value of color specified below is being added. If part of the object being tinted already has as much
;value of the color specified, then no change will be seen.
;At the level that the blitters opperate, colors are 16 bit numbers, using the 5,6,5 RGB scheme. This
;means that values of red range from 0 to 31, values of green from 0 to 63, and values of blue from 0
;to 31.
;If you change these colors, or add new ones, please keep the commented bit version up to date, if you
;don't know how, let me know and I'll fix it.

; **************************************************************************

; ******* Projectile Statistics *******
; Projectiles describe how and what image to use as the weapon flies
; to its target. Think of the projectile as the "delivery method" used
; to get the warhead to the desired target.

; AA = Can this weapon fire upon flying aircraft (def=no)?
; AG = Can this weapon fire upon ground objects (def=yes)?
; AN = Can this weapon fire upon naval objects (def=yes)?
; AS = Can this weapon fire upon sub-marine objects (def=no)?
; ASW = Is this an Anti-Submarine-Warfare projectile (def=no)?
; Acceleration = amount to increase missile speed (def=3)
; Airburst = Does it try to fly over the target instead of hit it (def=no)?
; Arcing = Does the bullet travel using an arcing path rather than a straight line? (def=no)
; Arm = arming delay (def=0)
; Bouncy = Does it bounce a bit upon impact (def=no)?
; Cluster = number of explosions attached to projectile [cluster-bomb] (def=1)
; Color = Color  to use for special remapping projectiles (def = none)
; CourseLockDuration = How many frames the projectile keep its initial course locked for. (def=0)
; Degenerates = Does the bullet strength weaken as it travels (def=no)?
; Dropping = Does it fall from a starting height (def=no)?
; Level = Does it stay at the same altitude in flight? (Currently also acts as IsTorpedo)
; Elasticity = "bounciness" of the object [should be 0.0 through 1.0] (def=0.75)
; Image = image to use during flight
; Inaccurate = Is it inherently inaccurate (def=no)?
; Inviso = Is the projectile invisible as it travels (def=no)?

; ******* Warhead Characteristics *******
; This is what gives the "rock, paper, scissors" character to the game.
; It describes how the damage is to be applied to the target. The
; values should take into consideration the 'area of effect'.
; example: Although an armor piercing tank round would instantly
; kill a soldier IF it hit, the anti-infantry rating is still
; very low because the tank round has such a limited area of
; effect, lacks pinpoint accuracy, and acknowledges the fact that
; tanks pose little threat to infantry that take cover.

; Spread = Obsolete.  Kept entries to give benchmark for new spread system
; Wall = Does this warhead damage concrete walls (def=no)?
; WallAbsoluteDestroyer = Does this warhead do killing damage to a wall, instead of one wound?  (def=no) ;gs
; Wood = Does this warhead damage wood walls (def=no)?
; Fire = Does this produce great heat and thus will melt ice (def=no)?
; Radiation = Is this a radiation weapon?  Certains units will be immune to this. (def=no)
; Tiberium = Does this warhead destroy tiberium (def=no)?
; Sparky = Does this warhead cause residual flames (def=no)?
; Conventional = Is explosive warhead big enough to cause a splash when it hits water [nukes are too big for this] (def=no)?
; Rocker = Can this warhead cause nearby units to rock upon impact (def=no)?
; AnimList = list of animations to play when warhead explodes [listed from lesser to greater damage]
; Verses = damage value verses various armor types (as percentage of full damage)...
;           -vs- None, Flak, Plate //infantry
;				Light, Medium, Heavy //units
;				Wood, Steel, Concrete //buildings
;				Special_1, Special_2 //dunno yet

; NOTE: (Double Note, a float math bug caused 2% to be used when 1% broke down.  Fixing the bug is why I made 2%)
; A 0% means no force fire, no retaliate, no passive aquire

; InfDeath = which infantry death animation to use (def=0)

; NEW ONES 6=Yuri head explode 7=Nuke Melt
; Even Newer 8=Virus explosion 9=Brute transformation
; Brand spankin new 10=get smashed into pieces by a brute
; Deform = % chance that this warhead will damage the ground when it hits. (def=0)
; DeformThreshhold = damage must exceed this amount before deformation can occur (def=0)
; Particle = Particle effect to use when explosion occurs (def=none)
; ProneDamage = Damage modifer for infantry when prone (def=1.0)
; Bright = Does this warhead normally cause a lighting effect when it goes off (def=no). This is overridden in the case of bullets by the weapon 'Bright' flag.
; CombatLightSize = % of max size; > 0% means force size of combat light, overriding damage-based value (def=0%)
; Bullets = Is this weapon a bunch of bullet-like gunfire?  (def=no).
; CellSpread (def 0)= Replaces Spread and WideDamage.  This is actually how far damage from this warhead can spread
;   0 will explicitly only hurt the target, anything higher will at least search some cells around and compare distance
; CellInset (def 0)=Use this to tell autodeploy how much inside CellSpread we need to get before autodeploying.
;   This way, the desolater won't just blast as soon as the target is on the very edge -- he'll move in a bit.
; PercentAtMax (def 1.0)= And this is the percent of damage it does at max range; to control fade linearly

; This specifies the chance for the specified crate powerup to appear
; in a 'random' crate. The chance is expressed in the form of 'shares'
; out of the total shares specified.
;
; The second parameter is the animation to use when this crate is picked up.
;
; The third parameter specifies whether this crate is available over water.
;
; The fourth parameter, if present, specifies
; the data value needed for that crate powerup. They mean different things
; for the different powerups.

; ******* Mission Control *******
; This specifies the various general behavior characteristics of
